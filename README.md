# 🚀 Sorting Visualizer 🎨

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application that helps users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms in real time. The project provides a dynamic representation of how different sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process step by step. 🏆

## ✨ Features

- 🎲 Supports multiple sorting algorithms:
  - 🔵 Bubble Sort
  - 🟡 Selection Sort
  - 🟢 Merge Sort
  - 🔴 Quick Sort
- ⏳ Adjustable speed for animations.
- 🔄 Ability to generate new random arrays.
- 📊 Interactive UI with visual bars representing array elements.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- 🏗 **HTML** - Structure of the webpage.
- 🎨 **CSS** - Styling and layout.
- 🖥 **JavaScript** - Implementing sorting algorithms and animations.
